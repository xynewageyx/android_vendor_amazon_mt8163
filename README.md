### Building

The build process is quite long and requires fair knowledge of Linux and its command line.

#### 1. Install Google's repo tool

```bash
# Add binary folder
mkdir -p ~/bin
# Add folder to path
PATH=~/bin:$PATH
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
source ~/.profile
```

#### 2. Download the Lineage OS 16.0 source code

You may have to restart your shell after Step 1 to refresh the PATH variable.

*Please note that this can take a very long time. At around 3 MB/s, it can take upwards of 1 hour!*

```bash
# Create soruce directory and cd into it
mkdir -p ~/android/lineage
cd <folder to contain source>
# Initialise repo tool
repo init -u git://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b lineage-16.0
repo sync
```

#### 3. Clone Fire device repositories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mt8163/android_device_amazon_karnak device/amazon/karnak
git clone https://github.com/mt8163/android_kernel_amazon_karnak kernel/amazon/karnak
git clone https://github.com/mt8163/android_vendor_amazon_karnak vendor/amazon/karnak
```

#### 4. Build!
```bash
curl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/488315/build_scripts/master/build.sh > build.sh
```



**Ensure you have `adb` and `fastboot` installed and in your path before continuing!**
Learn how to do this here: https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/bacon/build#build-lineageos-and-lineageos-recovery

```bash
# Ubuntu 16.04 and newer
apt-get install bc bison build-essential ccache curl flex g++-multilib gcc-multilib git gnupg gperf imagemagick lib32ncurses5-dev lib32readline-dev lib32z1-dev liblz4-tool libncurses5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libssl-dev libwxgtk3.0-dev libxml2 libxml2-utils lzop pngcrush rsync schedtool squashfs-tools xsltproc zip zlib1g-dev

# Older than Ubuntu 16.04
apt-get install bc bison build-essential ccache curl flex g++-multilib gcc-multilib git gnupg gperf imagemagick lib32ncurses5-dev lib32readline-dev lib32z1-dev liblz4-tool libncurses5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libssl-dev libwxgtk2.8-dev libxml2 libxml2-utils lzop pngcrush rsync schedtool squashfs-tools xsltproc zip zlib1g-dev

# All versions
croot
source ./build/envsetup.sh
brunch lineage_karnak-userdebug
```

### Improving build times

To speed up subsequent builds, you can enable ccache support. You can do this by running this command before each build:
```bash
export USE_CCACHE=1
```
You can also add this line to your `~/.bashrc` file. After, you need to specify the maximum disk space ccache can use:
```bash
# 25 GB
ccache -M 25G
# 50 GB (recommended)
ccache -M 50G
# 75 GB
ccache -M 75G
```
> This needs to be run once. Anywhere from 25GB-100GB will result in very noticeably increased build speeds (for instance, a typical 1hr build time can be reduced to 20min). **If youâ€™re only building for one device, 25GB-50GB is fine.** If you plan to build for several devices that do not share the same kernel source, aim for 75GB-100GB. This space will be permanently occupied on your drive, so take this into consideration.
